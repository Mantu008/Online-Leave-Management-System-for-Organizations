📌 Title
Online Leave Management System (MERN Stack)
A web-based leave application and approval system for organizations with role-based access, holiday blocking, and real-time notifications.

📝 Description
The Online Leave Management System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows employees to apply for leaves, view their leave history, and track approvals.
